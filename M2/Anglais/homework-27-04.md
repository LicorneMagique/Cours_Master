# Homework

Si je pouvais changer tout ce que je voulais sur le web :

- J'interdirai toutes les boites mails qui ne signent pas leur mails ou qui ne vérifient pas les signatures
- taille despages outragement trop grosses -> standardiser les pages en version light
- obligation d'utiliser du json à la place du xml
- interdire tous les sites qui font des animations en javascript quand il existe un équivalent full css
- j'aurai monté un groupe de développeur dont la mission aurait été de développer un transcompiler flashplayer -> javascript/canvas pour continuer de jouer aux jeux sur jeu.fr

If there was one thing I could change about the Internet, it would be to prohibit all the abominations that are still there since 2010.
First I would ban all mail box that aren't signing emails or not verifying email's signatures ALL THE TIME. That's probably the older and huger security problem of the Internet because anybody can send an email to anyone pretending to be who they want. I don't understand why Google and Microsoft didn't already impose a standard signature system, but if I could I would.
Then I would instore a standard light version on all websites, let's say a 500 kB version that your browser would show you while it is loading the full version. Too much developpers and mostfully Wordpress website creators think everyone has a super powerfull smartphone or a gaming computer and that's why sometime you wait 10 seconds for a website to load because of an add or beautifull animations, while the only thing you wanted was to read an article.
Finally I would prohibit the use of XML as a data transfert format because it's the most verbose way format ever and nobody enjoy reading or modifying it. JSON would be the official unique standard.
